My Topic: Enhancing Web Application Quality through Module Testing 

Test Types			Test Case
Functional Tests		Valid login, invalid password, empty fields, adding products
 (with Authentication)
Input Validation		special characters, long input
Edge Cases			Min/max character length for username/password
Security Tests			Brute Force Attack Prevention

For https://www.aliexpress.com/, i want to perform these test cases in Selenium to make a project.
- My files contain with Selenium (Selenium-server-4.27.0.jar)) in where i want to integrate the project:
- First, give me file structure,
- Second, write codes correctly and carefully and without any errors one by one for Selenium not Maven or anything else.

Here are my webdriver path: System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "C:\\Drivers\\chromedriver.exe");	
Package: package sampleapp;
Main class: public class practice

Well, complete the project.


Modules = Parts

- Check codes one-by-one because testings are running but not showing the processes in the website's interface.
- Hold for a while in every testing
- In FunctionalTests, perform: Valid login, invalid login, empty fields, adding products, checkpout
- Add payment testing
- In InputValidation, perform: special characters, long input
- In EdgeCases, perform: Min/max character length for username/password
- In SecurityTests, perform: Brute Force Attack Prevention
- In practice (main java class), organize all the tests methods one after one so that 
testings can be performed sequentially.
Well, now write the codes carefully, correctly, without any error so that testings 
will be executed successfully and showing the processes in the website's interfaces.

Give me some professional website where I can perform these tests successfully. 

Add this website () all the files where needs and make changes then write correctly every code without any error.

As you remember all files for this project, recheck all the files and make a README.md file and .gitignore file
